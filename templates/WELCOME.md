Hi {{ names }},

We’re so excited that you’re wanting to start a PyLadies in {{ city }}!!

I've created `{{ email }}` email - so expect an email (to your personal email address) within a few minutes on setting up your PyLadies account (http://www.google.com/a/pyladies.com), and then go ahead and sign up for any accounts for PyLadies that you need with this new email (e.g. Meetup, Twitter, etc).

Once done with signing up for everything, please complete the part II of the checklist [1].

To get {{ location }} listed under `http://www.pyladies.com/locations/`, please make a pull request to `github.com/pyladies/pyladies`.  You just need to edit the `config.yml` file under the `www` directory.

When you want your own site, you can either create a static/all client-side site within the repo itself (like you see with others) and submit a pull request, or if you want it to have server side logic (like a Flask/Django app or something), then we can deploy it on Heroku (just let me know).

Please do *not* buy any domains - all domains are managed by PyLadies and the Python Software Foundation.  We'll be able to setup “{{ location website }}" or whatever you'd like when you're ready.

If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask me or Esther.

Welcome!
